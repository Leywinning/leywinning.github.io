    <p>Valorant agents each offer unique playstyles and abilities.. First, figure out if you prefer to support your team, scout out enemies, or deal direct damage. Then, focus on learning a few agents in your role. Learning a specific agent can help with how you learn to play the game. Once youâ€™ve master one of them, start experimenting with others to be more flexible when it comes to team creation.</p>
    <h2>Mastering the Maps</h2>

    <p>Understanding the maps is an important aspect of the game. Always be aware of key spots like chokepoints and common hiding spots. Try to remember the callouts of each places and practice rotating through the map to react quickly to changes in the round. Good map knowledge can often win you the round even if your opponents have better aim!</p>
